# Classification Model For Drug Side Effects

High Blood Pressure or Hypertension is a condition in which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high. Usually, hypertension is defined as blood pressure above 140/90, and is considered severe if the pressure is above 180/120. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. Over time, if untreated, it can cause health conditions, such as heart disease and stroke. Eating a healthier diet with less salt, exercising regularly, and taking medication can help lower blood pressure.

However, all medicines have risks. There are side effects of using Blood Pressure medicine. The purpose of this project to write a model to classify the side effects based on age, gender, and race that will help in identifying group of people to take precautions accroding to medication. 

The development process includes:
1.	Creating a dataset that contains Name, Age, Gender, Race, Side effects of 4,00,000 patients.
2.	Clean the dataset.
3.	Sanitize the dataset.
4.	Pre-process the data to perform data portioning and handle missing values.
5.	Create training and testing sets.
6.	Build a classifier and fit the data to the model.
7.	Check the accuracy of the model and measure its effectiveness.

**NOTE: This is an internship project. The dataset added in this repository contains dummy data and should not be treated as original.**
